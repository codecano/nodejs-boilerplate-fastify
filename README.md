# Nodejs Boilerplate Fastify

Nodejs Boilerplate Fastify is an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework designed to help developers create REST APIs more efficiently. It leverages Fastify, a highly performant web framework for Node.js, along with several other essential packages for rapid and secure development.

## Features

- **Fast API Development**: Built with Fastify for optimal performance and quick setup of REST APIs.
- **Security**: Integrates `bcryptjs` for password hashing and `jsonwebtoken` for authentication.
- **Data Handling**: Uses `mongoose` for MongoDB object modeling and database interaction.
- **Logging**: Employs `winston` for effective logging and error handling.
- **Environment Management**: Supports `.env` files with `dotenv` for environment configuration.
- **Date Handling**: `moment` is used for easy date manipulation.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: `cross-env` helps manage environment variables across different operating systems.
- **TypeScript Support**: Developed with TypeScript to ensure type safety and better development experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/9techofficial/Nodejs-Boilerplate-Fastify.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nodejs-boilerplate-fastify
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project, similar to `.env.example`.

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
